## Functional Programming

I know a functional programming joke about a functional programming joke about a functional programming joke about a functional programming joke...

## Machine Learning

These machine learning jokes write themselves...eventually.

## Databases

A SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables and says "mind if I join you?"

## Programming
